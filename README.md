# Word-Count-with-MapReduce-and-openMP

• Created a map function in C++ which could pair each word as the key with value of integer one after the input article has been divided into one-word segments and created a reduce function which could sum up the value with same key

• Applied multithread to the reduce function so that it could sum up the value of different keys at the same time

• Substituted OpenMP for multithread which has the same usage but easier to implement
